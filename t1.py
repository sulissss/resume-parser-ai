I ordered a laptop from your store last week (Order #12345), but I received a tablet instead.

Drawbacks of this approach:
1. No structured output, making it difficult to integrate into automated systems
2. No validation of the output, potentially leading to inconsistent categorizations
3. Limited information extracted, missing important details for prioritization
4. No confidence score, making it hard to flag uncertain classifications for human review

# Step 1: Get clear on your objectives
# --------------------------------------------------------------

"""
Objective: Develop an AI-powered ticket classification system that:
- Accurately categorizes customer support tickets
- Assesses the urgency and sentiment of each ticket
- Extracts key information for quick resolution
- Provides confidence scores to flag uncertain cases for human review
Business impact:
- Reduce average response time by routing tickets to the right department
- Improve customer satisfaction by prioritizing urgent and negative sentiment tickets
- Increase efficiency by providing agents with key information upfront
- Optimize workforce allocation by automating routine classifications

"""
This code defines a structured data model for classifying customer support tickets using Pydantic and Python's Enum class. 
It specifies categories, urgency levels, customer sentiments, and other relevant information as predefined options or constrained fields. 
This structure ensures data consistency, enables automatic validation, and facilitates easy integration with AI models and other parts of a support ticket system.

# To optimize:
# 1. Refine the system message to provide more context about your business

# 3. Fine-tune the model on your specific ticket data if available
# 4. Adjust the TicketClassification model based on business needs

You are an AI assistant for a large e-commerce platform's customer support team. 
Your role is to analyze incoming customer support tickets and provide structured information to help our team respond quickly and effectively.
Business Context:
- We handle thousands of tickets daily across various categories (orders, accounts, products, technical issues, billing).
- Quick and accurate classification is crucial for customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
- We prioritize based on urgency and customer sentiment.
Your tasks:
1. Categorize the ticket into the most appropriate category.
2. Assess the urgency of the issue (low, medium, high, critical).
3. Determine the customer's sentiment.
4. Extract key information that would be helpful for our support team.
5. Suggest an initial action for handling the ticket.
6. Provide a confidence score for your classification.
Remember:
- Be objective and base your analysis solely on the information provided in the ticket.
- If you're unsure about any aspect, reflect that in your confidence score.
- For 'key_information', extract specific details like order numbers, product names, or account issues.
- The 'suggested_action' should be a brief, actionable step for our support team.
Analyze the following customer support ticket and provide the requested information in the specified format.
